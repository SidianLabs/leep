# Operating Leep

## Logs

`leep-server` logs with `tracing`. Choose the format with `--log-format
text|json` (env `LEEP_LOG_FORMAT`, default `text`); filter with `RUST_LOG`
(default `info`). Use `json` when a log pipeline ingests the output: one JSON
object per line.

Every HTTP request produces one INFO line, `request completed`, inside a
`request` span. The span carries `method`, `route` (the matched template such
as `/v1/blobs/{hash}`, or `unmatched`), `status` and `latency_ms`:

```json
{"timestamp":"...","level":"INFO","fields":{"message":"request completed","status":404,"latency_ms":0.39},"target":"leep_server::observe","span":{"method":"GET","route":"/v1/blobs/{hash}","status":404,"latency_ms":0.39,"name":"request"}}
```

Headers are never logged, so `Authorization` values cannot appear. The
authentication span (DEBUG) records the token's name, never its value.
Server-side failures additionally log an ERROR line with the error text.

## Metrics

Metrics are off by default. Start the server with `--metrics-listen <ADDR>`
(env `LEEP_METRICS_LISTEN`), for example `127.0.0.1:9187`, and scrape
`GET /metrics` (Prometheus text format). The listener is separate from the
API port, needs no token and serves nothing else, so bind it to a private
interface or network and never publish it through the API's reverse proxy.
The address is logged at startup.

Instrumentation uses the `metrics` facade, which does nothing unless a
recorder is installed; only the server binary installs one. HTTP latency is
measured until the response head is ready, not until the body is streamed.

| Metric | Type | Labels | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `leep_http_requests_total` | counter | `method`, `route`, `status` | Requests handled. `route` is the matched template or `unmatched`; unknown methods are `other`. |
| `leep_http_request_duration_seconds` | histogram | `method`, `route` | Time to produce the response head. |
| `leep_land_total` | counter | `outcome` = `landed`, `conflicts`, `exhausted`, `error` | Land calls by result. `conflicts` is a normal reply that needs client action; `exhausted` means the CAS lost every retry. |
| `leep_land_attempts` | histogram | none | CAS attempts per land that reached the retry loop; above 1 means contention. |
| `leep_land_cas_losses_total` | counter | none | Lost ref compare-and-swaps (races with other server instances). |
| `leep_land_duration_seconds` | histogram | none | Whole land call, including lock wait. |
| `leep_land_lock_wait_seconds` | histogram | none | Time waiting on the per-ref in-process land lock. |
| `leep_derive_total` | counter | `kind` | Derived values computed (cache hits in the meta store are not counted). |
| `leep_derive_duration_seconds` | histogram | `kind` | Time to compute one derived value. |
| `leep_blob_cache_hits_total` | counter | none | Blob reads served from the in-memory cache. |
| `leep_blob_cache_misses_total` | counter | none | Blob reads that went to the durable store. |
| `leep_blob_cache_bytes` | gauge | none | Bytes held in the cache. |
| `leep_blob_cache_entries` | gauge | none | Blobs held in the cache. |
| `leep_build_info` | gauge | `version` | Always 1; carries the server version. |

Seconds histograms use buckets from 1 ms to 10 s; `leep_land_attempts` uses
1 to 32. The cache metrics are recorded by `CachedBlobStore` itself as it
serves requests (the gauges refresh on every read and write), so there is no
polling interval. With `--cache-bytes 0` there is no cache and the
`leep_blob_cache_*` series are absent.
