# Leep formats and compatibility

Anything listed here is persisted or sent over the wire. Changing it
carelessly corrupts history or breaks deployed clients, so every change goes
through the [`change-persistent-format`](../.claude/skills/change-persistent-format/SKILL.md)
skill.

## Hashing

- Algorithm: BLAKE3, 32 bytes. Hex is lowercase, 64 characters.
- Blob: `BLAKE3(raw file bytes)`, with no header.
- Object: `BLAKE3("leep:" ‖ kind ‖ 0x00 ‖ postcard(object))`, where `kind`
  carries a version suffix (`changeset-v1`, `tree-v1`). This domain separation
  means a blob can never collide with an object.

## Binary encoding

- `postcard` (serde), using `BTreeMap` for every map, so encoding is
  deterministic. **Field order and enum variant order are part of the
  format.** Reordering fields or variants changes every hash.
- Enums are externally tagged. postcard cannot decode internally tagged
  enums, so `#[serde(tag = ...)]` is banned on persisted types.
- `Hash` serializes as 32 raw bytes in binary formats and as hex in JSON.

## Persisted types (v1)

| Type | Kind tag | Where |
|---|---|---|
| `Changeset` | `changeset-v1` | `MetaStore.changesets.data` |
| `TreeNode` | `tree-v1` | `BlobStore`, keyed by `TreeNode::hash()` |
| derived `root_tree` | — | `MetaStore.derived`, value = 32 raw bytes |
| derived `generation` | — | `MetaStore.derived`, value = u64 (owned by leep-derive) |
| other derived kinds | — | owned and versioned by `leep-derive` |

## Versioning rules

1. **Never change v1 types in place.** That includes field order, variant
   order, added fields and serde attributes. Make a new version (`-v2`) with
   its own kind tag, and keep the v1 decoder forever.
2. Derived data is disposable. To change a derived kind's encoding, rename the
   kind (`blame` → `blame-v2`). Old rows are ignored and can be garbage
   collected later.
3. `extra` is how history gets new metadata without changing the format. Use
   namespaced keys (`agent.*`, `leep.*`, `review.*`).
4. HTTP API: `/v1` endpoints only grow, by adding endpoints or optional
   fields with `#[serde(default)]`. Removing or renaming anything requires
   `/v2`, served alongside v1.
5. SQL schemas migrate forward only. Migrations are idempotent and live in
   `leep-meta`.

## SQL schema (leep-meta)

```
changesets(id BYTEA PRIMARY KEY, data BYTEA NOT NULL)          -- data = Changeset::encode()
refs(name TEXT PRIMARY KEY, target BYTEA NOT NULL)
derived(kind TEXT, key BYTEA, value BYTEA, PRIMARY KEY(kind, key))
```

## Blob storage layout (leep-store)

- Filesystem: `<root>/<hex[0..2]>/<hex[2..]>`
- Object store: `blobs/<hex[0..2]>/<hex[2..]>`

## Garbage collection (no format change)

ADR 0008 adds `BlobStore::list_page` and `delete` and `MetaStore::list_changesets`.
These are trait additions only: no encoding, hash, SQL schema or blob layout
changed. Listings walk the existing layouts: filesystem shard directories and
object-store `blobs/<hex[0..2]>/` prefixes in hash order, and
`SELECT id FROM changesets ORDER BY id` (byte order) for metadata. Blob
modification time is the file mtime or object `LastModified`; a repeated `put`
refreshes it.
