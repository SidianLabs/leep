# Changelog

All notable changes to Leep are recorded here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/). Leep has not
had a release; versions stay below 0.1.0 until the maintainer cuts one
(see [docs/ROADMAP.md](docs/ROADMAP.md)).

## [Unreleased]

### Core loop (M1)
- Content-addressed data model (BLAKE3, postcard), storage traits and API
  types.
- Blob stores: filesystem, S3-compatible and an LRU cache. Metadata
  stores: SQLite and Postgres.
- Derived data: trees, generation numbers, skiplists, diff, log, blame,
  merge and rebase.
- `land` without a merge queue: replays the whole unlanded stack, reports
  conflicts instead of resolving them, and retries lost races with backoff.
- HTTP server, a CLI with lazy sparse checkouts, and a git bridge that
  imports and exports with full round-trip.

### Operable (M2)
- Token auth with read and write roles (ADR 0007).
- JSON logs and Prometheus metrics.
- Docker image and a compose stack with Postgres.
- Blob garbage collection (ADR 0008).
- Benchmarks for commit, land and merge-base.

### Agent-native (M3)
- MCP server exposing Leep to AI agents (ADR 0009).
- Provenance queries over `agent.*` metadata.
- Signed changesets and a `--require-signatures` land policy (ADR 0010).
- Review service with `OWNERS` files and semantic auto-approval
  (ADR 0011).
- Fenced two-phase blob GC (ADR 0012).

### History and search (M4)
- Path-history index and `leep last-change` (ADR 0013).
- Server-side code search: `leep search`, `GET /v1/search` and the MCP
  `leep_search` tool (ADR 0014).

### Everyday workflow
- `leep branch` lists, creates and deletes branches. `branch -d` deletes
  only a branch already merged into the working copy's target ref; `-D`
  deletes it anyway. Both are compare-and-swap, so a concurrent move fails
  with a 409 instead of being overwritten.
- `leep switch BRANCH` (and `switch -c NAME [REV]`) moves a clean working
  copy to another branch.
- `leep tag` lists, creates (`tag NAME [REV]`) and deletes (`tag -d NAME`)
  tags, stored as the refs `tags/NAME`. The server never lets a tag move,
  and `land` onto `tags/` is refused.
- Revisions accept `tags/NAME`, and a short tag name when no branch has that
  name.
- The server checks every ref name written through `POST /v1/refs/{name}`
  and `land` (git-like rules, `docs/FORMATS.md`) and answers 400 for an
  invalid one. Existing valid names keep working.
- Deleting a ref that a land policy (signatures, review) covers is now
  refused with 400.
- Rename detection when displaying (ADR 0016): `leep diff` and `leep status`
  show `renamed: old -> new (NN%)`, with `--no-renames` and `-M[=N]`;
  `GET /v1/diff` takes `renames` and `rename_threshold`; the MCP `leep_diff`
  tool takes `renames`.
- `leep log --follow FILE` continues a file's history under its old names;
  `GET /v1/log` takes `follow`, and the MCP `leep_log` tool takes `follow`.

### Project
- Workspace version set to 0.0.1, with a CI check that keeps it below
  0.1.0.
- Apache-2.0 license text, security policy and this changelog.
- Product direction (`docs/PRODUCT.md`) and a draft contributor license
  agreement (`CLA.md`). Pull requests are merged by the maintainer only.
